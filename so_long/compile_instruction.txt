cc <program.c> -Lminilibx-linux -lmlx_Linux -lX11 -lXext

if the above line doesn't work, try with:

cc <program.c> -Lminilibx-linux ./lib/minilibx-linux/libmlx_Linux.a -lX11 -lXext


-Lminilibx-linux: This flag specifies the directory where CC should look for libraries. minilibx-linux is the directory where the MinilibX library for linux is located.

-lmlx_Linux: This flag tells cc to ling against the libmlx_Linux.a or -libmlx_Linux.so library. Here, mlx_Linux corresponds to the MinilibX library for linux systems. In case of compilation error, try with the compilation alternative.

-lX11: This flag is for linking afainst the X11 library, which is a graphical user interface library for the X Window System. MinilibX utilizes the X Window System to manage windows, graphics drawing, and user input on UNIX-like operating systems, which includes Linux.

-lXext: This is for linking against the Xext library, which provides extensions to the X Window System. MinilibX might be using some of these extension for its funcionalities.

When you are using these flags, you are telling the compiler:

 - Where to find the MinilibX library files (-Lminilibx-linux)
 - Which libraries to link with (-lmlx_Linux -lX11 -lXext)
 
 This ensures that your C files have access to the necessary functions and structures defined within the MinilibX library, as well as any functionalities from the X11 and Xext libraries thar MinilibX might depend on.
